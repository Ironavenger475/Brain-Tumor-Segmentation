# Brain Tumor Segmentation Using Image processing and CRTL Algorithm

In this context, we propose to leverage the power of fetal brain MRI super-resolution (SR) reconstruction methods to generate multiple reconstructions of a single subject with different parameters thus as an efficient tuning-free data augmentation strategy.

We use 3 modules: CTRL Algorithm, Segmentation using TL and DL techniques, and Image segmentation
